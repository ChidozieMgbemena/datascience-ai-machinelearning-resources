# Artificial Intelligence

## Types

- AI (encompasses machine learning and other fields)
    + Strong/weak
    + Deep/narrow
    + Hard/soft
    + General
- Machine learning (ML, and subset of AI)
    + Primary
        * Supervised
            - Regression
            - Classification
        * Unsupervised
            - Clustering
            - Anomaly detection
        * Semi-supervised
        * Reinforcement learning
    + Other
        * Transfer learning
        * Recommender systems
            - Content-based and collaborative-based filtering
        * Ensemble methods
            - Bagging (random forests) and boosting

## Common Algorithms

- AI
    + Neural networks and deep learning
        * Specific algorithms
        * Notes
            - Deep learning 'learns to learn' in that the algorithm 'picks' the features automatically
- ML

## AI and ML Process (High-level)

- Ask the right question
- Obtain the data
- Parse and process the data
- EDA - statistical analysis and data visualization
- Choose models/algorithms and performance metric
- Iterate and improve performance
- Deliver/communicate/present results

## AI and ML Considerations and Tradeoffs (High-level)

- Overfitting (bias vs variance, noise)
- Model performance vs interpretability
- Model complexity vs simplicity (i.e., parsimony)
- Curse of dimensionality
- Unsupervised learning limitations for AI
