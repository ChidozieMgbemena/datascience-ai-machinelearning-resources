    + Suppose you need to split the product work so that one person handles the high level product vision, strategy, and prioritized roadmap. The other person is responsible for executing, developing, and delivering the roadmap at the team level.
    + The development team thinks that a feature is stupid or unnecessary
    + The stakeholders change immediate priority, but work is already in progress for suddenly de-prioritized features

    + The roadmap and backlog is getting too large and contains too many features.
