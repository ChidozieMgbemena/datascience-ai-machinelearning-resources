    + Delivery deadlines are close and you find out last minute that the requirements and/or what was asked of the team has been misunderstood, or missed completely. What to do in that situation, and also to prevent in the future.
    + Stakeholders do not understand why you're not prioritizing their feature requests and/or ideas for the product
    + Stakeholders have unreasonable requests or time expectations
    + The team needs your help getting questions answered, getting unblocked, understanding requirements, or is just giving status updates. They feel that a lot of detail is necessary to explain, when really you only need high level summaries and explanations.
    + Suppose you need to split the product work so that one person handles the high level product vision, strategy, and prioritized roadmap. The other person is responsible for executing, developing, and delivering the roadmap at the team level.
    + The development team thinks that a feature is stupid or unnecessary
    + The stakeholders change immediate priority, but work is already in progress for suddenly de-prioritized features
    + The team identifies many small features that are part of a larger epic, or master feature. Stakeholders would like to only do some of the features, but not all, and despite that the team things they're all critical.
    + Stakeholders are constantly changing requirements, priorities, and/or increasing scope, but are unwilling to increase budget or move deadlines.
    + Stakeholders need something developed and delivered by a fixed date, but the team estimates that it's impossible to accommodate, and it's also impossible to add any additional resources to the team to help.
        * If you could add more resources to the team, what are some potential concerns in doing so?
    + The roadmap and backlog is getting too large and contains too many features.
